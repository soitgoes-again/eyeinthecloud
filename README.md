# Eye in the Cloud - A Google AI Studio Focused Experience

This userscript adds the "Eye," giving you enhanced control over Google AI Studio. Hide UI panels, customize chat history visibility, use a dedicated prompt composer, and create full themes, including AI-generated ones via Gemini (no API connection needed!). A "VIBE" mode offers quick focus.

Installs like any other userscript via Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey, etc.

## What it Does:

*   **UI Customization:** Hide sidebars, toolbars, prompt chips, and feedback buttons for a cleaner interface.
*   **Chat History Control:** Choose to view all history or limit it to a specific number of recent exchanges.
*   **Themes:** Apply predefined themes (like DOS or Nature) or generate your own custom themes using the chat! Gemini will create your theme with icons, all without any API.
*   **Prompt Composer:** A dedicated text area designed for lag-free typing, with quick access to a library of reusable prompt snippets.
*   **VIBE Mode:** Instantly switch to a predefined minimalist layout for maximum focus.

## How to Use:

1.  Install the script using your userscript manager.
2.  Navigate to Google AI Studio.
3.  Access the main menu via the floating eye icon at the top, or open the Prompt Composer via the chat bubble near the input text.

## Future Plans:

1. Create the Eye for other websites
2. The Eye takes over the world
3. Maker of Rules, Dealing With Fools
